  description: Most cancer genomes experience DNA amplifications as the most common gain-of-function alterations. These amplifications lead to cancer by overexpressing oncogenes. Amplifications include regulatory elements that promote transcription. However, a systematic exploration of how amplifications hijack transcriptional regulation is lacking. We hypothesize that high-level amplifications exploit tissue-specific enhancers and transcription factors to promote aberrant oncogene expression and cancer growth. Understanding if these regulatory factors are essential for cancer growth could lead to novel therapies that target tissue-specific gene regulation.

We are looking for two highly motivated PhD candidates (one in bioinformatics and one in experimental biology) interested in investigating how cancer cells change the 3D genome to hijack gene regulation for aberrant expression of oncogenes from high-level genomic amplifications. The bioinformatics part of the project will involve whole genome sequencing and epigenetic analysis of several hundred tumor samples from breast and lung cancer patients. In the experimental biology part, we will model recurrent oncogenic changes to the 3D genome observed in these cancers using CRISPR-based approaches. 

Your responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, the following activities:
- Bioinformatics PhD student: Analysis of sequencing data from short-read and long-read WGS, methylation, HiC, ATAC, ChIP, and RNAseq data starting from the raw data/ fastq files. 
- Bioinformatics PhD student: Identify significantly recurrent genomic changes in cohorts of tumor samples 
- Experimental biology PhD student: Isolation and processing of primary patient tumor tissue and cell lines for multi-omic sequencing
- Experimental biology PhD student: Analysis and interpretation of variant calls from WGS and epigenetic analysis of cell lines
- Experimental biology PhD student: CRISPR perturbations of cell lines and validation experiments of cell growth and oncogene expression
- Document progress, communicate and present analyses to the group, institute members, and collaborators verbally and in writing.
- Work with members of the group and collaborators as well as independently with respect to experimental design, data analysis, and visualization. 

Your profile 
- Bioinformatics PhD student: MSc in Bioinformatics, Data Science, Computer Science, or Biostatistics similar. 
- Bioinformatics PhD student: Experience in computational biology (sequencing and data analysis, machine learning)
- Experimental biology PhD student: MSc in Biology, Biochemistry, Bioengineering, or similar.
- Experimental biology PhD student: Experience in experimental biology (tissue culture, molecular biology, biochemistry). Experience in functional genomics (CRISPR-perturbation) is beneficial.
- Strong intrinsic motivation, scientific curiosity, organizational skills, and a strong interest in learning about novel technologies.
- Strong communication skills in written and spoken English.
- Being collaborative and proactive. 

We offer a friendly, collaborative, and fast-paced environment that strives for scientific excellence, investigating clinically impactful questions, and developing each team member. The pay scale will be the standard 65% E13 PhD contract. We also offer a chance to affiliate with the [CompCancer](https://www.comp-cancer.de/) grad school for the bioinformatics PhD student and the [BSIO](https://www.bsio-cancerschool.de/) for the experimental biology PhD student. 

Please send your application as a single pdf file, including a cover letter indicating your research interests, potential starting date, a curriculum vitae, publication list, and contact information of up to three references to frank.dubois@charite.de.
